    --mount=type=tmpfs,dst=/tmp \
    rm /opt # this is a file not a directory currently \
    mkdir /opt # create the opt directory so files can be installed to it \
    /ctx/build.sh \
    mv /opt /usr/share/factory # move files installed to /opt to /usr/share/factory so they will be in the final image \
    ln -s /var/opt /opt # restore symlink between /var/opt and /opt again \
